**Description**

A PyQt5 desktop application that displays your Spotify listening data in a Spotify Wrapped style slideshow.

<br /> 

**Steps**

Spotify allows you to request your extended streaming history from this link:
[https://www.spotify.com/in-en/account/privacy/](https://www.spotify.com/in-en/account/privacy/)

After submitting the request, youâ€™ll receive multiple JSON files containing detailed information about every song you've listened to since creating your Spotify account.

This application reads those JSON files and transforms your streaming history into a set of engaging and easy-to-understand statistics.

You can find the application in the latest release: **Spotify_Stats.exe**

<br /> 

**Features**

1. Total minutes listened
2. Total tracks played
3. Top 5 songs
4. Top 5 artists
5. Top album
6. Song completion rate

**Program In Use**
